              <strong>ADHD (Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder)</strong> is a neurodevelopmental 
              condition affecting approximately 5-7% of children worldwide. It's characterized by consistent 
              patterns of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity that interfere with development or functioning.

            <p>
              ADHD involves differences in brain structure and neurotransmitter function, particularly 
              in areas responsible for executive functions like focus, impulse control, and organization. 
              These differences are largely genetic and neurobiologicalâ€”not the result of parenting or diet.

                  <p>
                    ADHD is a neurobiological condition affecting brain development and function. 
                    Brain imaging studies show distinct differences in neural pathways related to attention 
                    and executive function. Research confirms that appropriate medication combined with 
                    behavioral therapy improves focus by 40-60% in most children.

                    Studies show that when proper diagnostic protocols are followed, ADHD identification 
                    is consistent across different populations. The increase in diagnoses reflects better 
                    awareness and improved screening. Furthermore, research indicates that children with 
                    ADHD who receive appropriate treatment show better long-term outcomes in academic 
                    achievement, social relationships, and mental health.

                    Many children with ADHD can hyperfocus on activities they find interesting or stimulating. 
                    The challenge is with regulating attention rather than a complete inability to focus. 
                    This hyperfocus can actually become a strength when channeled into productive activities 
                    aligned with the child's interests.

              <li>
                <strong>Timer challenge:</strong> Set a timer for how long you'll use screens, 
                then take a break to move your body
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Learning apps:</strong> Try apps like Prodigy Math or Epic Reading that
