                          The legendary filmmaker wasn't diagnosed with dyslexia until his 60s. His reading difficulties 
                          led to bullying in school, but his visual thinking and storytelling abilities became his strengths. 
                          His dyslexic thinking has contributed to his exceptional visual storytelling and creativity.

                          Diagnosed with dyslexia at age six, Knightley used her love of acting as motivation to improve her

                          effective strategies. Her strong visual memory helps her excel at script memorization.
